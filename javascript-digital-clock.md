# JavaScript Digital Clock

Let's make a digital clock together as a class in JavaScript! It should show local time and tick every second, minute, and hour. Bonus: make it show milliseconds! Style it to look awesome.

When we're done, you can find the source code at [https://github.com/nycda/digital-clock](https://github.com/nycda/digital-clock)
